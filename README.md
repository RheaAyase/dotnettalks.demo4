## C# on Linux - demo3

This repository contains .NET Core demo that I use during some of my talks. Please note that this code contains hacks and should not be taken seriously - it serves only as demonstration of interacting with the Linux system.  
This demo is built on top of [Tom's DBus library](https://github.com/tmds/Tmds.DBus).

#### Contents:

* `master` branch - just about everything.
* `cli-only` branch - contains only the basic _cli_ demo.
* `web-api` branch - finished demo application with _web api._
* `dotnettalk.conf` - Apache vhost with simple proxy configuration.
* `example.service` - An example systemd service.
