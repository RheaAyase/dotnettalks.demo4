## C# on Linux - demo4

This repository contains .NET Core demo that I use during some of my talks. Please note that this code contains hacks and should not be taken seriously - it serves only as demonstration of interacting with the Linux system.  
This demo is built on top of [Tom's DBus library](https://github.com/tmds/Tmds.DBus).
